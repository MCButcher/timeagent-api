# timeagent-api
The api is a lightweight framework for scheduling or running your own implementation as a job.  
You can set a crontrigger or/and run them manually immediately.  

## Features
- The so-called agent has some information data for you to analyze the current status
- When implementing your code you have the possibility to add protocol entries
- A manual run can be executed with arguments so that you can configure them inside your implementation
